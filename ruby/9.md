## Troubleshooting

Here is help if you’ve encountered issues installing or running Ruby.

### asdf "No version set for command"

If you see "No version set for command" like this:

```bash
$ ruby -v
No version set for command node
Consider adding one of the following versions in your config file at
ruby 3.0.0
```

You need to specify a default version of the language in your home `~/.tool-versions` file.

You can set the `~/.tool-versions` file with a command:

```bash
$ asdf global ruby 3.0.0
```

Your `~/.tool-versions` file will look like this:

```bash
ruby 3.0.0
```

### Gem pristine warning

If you get a warning, `Ignoring ... because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine ...`:

![](/assets/images/ruby/gem-pristine-error.png)

Close and re-open the terminal window to start a new terminal session and try again.

### Conflicting bundler versions (with Rails)

If you install a version of Bundler that is newer than the default installed with Ruby, you will get a message `Warning: the running version of Bundler (2.1.2) is older than the version that created the lockfile (2.1.4)` when you run a Rails command. You can avoid the warning by prepending `bundle exec`, for example `bundle exec rails -T`. It's not possible to remove a default gem with `gem uninstall bundler` so it's advisable not to install a newer version of Bundler unless absolutely necessary.

### Problems with "Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect"

Ruby and RubyGems (starting with Ruby 1.9.3p194 and RubyGems 1.8.23) require verification of server SSL certificates when Ruby makes an Internet connection via https. If you run `rails new` and get an error `Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate` see this article suggesting solutions: [OpenSSL errors and Rails](http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html).

### Problems with "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error `OpenSSL certificate verify failed` when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See this article suggesting solutions: [OpenSSL errors and Rails](http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html).

### Installing in a second account

If you've created a second user account on your Mac, and the first user has already installed Homebrew, the first user may have to change permissions for the `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/Cellar` folders:

```bash
$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/bin
$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/Cellar
```

The second user account should be given admin privileges using the System Preferences "Users and Groups" setting.
