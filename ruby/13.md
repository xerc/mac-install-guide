## Install Ruby with Homebrew

Here are instructions for `brew install ruby`, or how to install Ruby with Homebrew.

### Steps

This is a complete guide to installing Ruby with Homebrew on a Mac.
- Update macOS.
- Install Homebrew.
- Install Ruby.
- Update settings in the `~/.zshrc` file (as needed).

### Who this is for

Use Homebrew to install Ruby if you are a casual user and won't be using Ruby frequently. For example:
- you are just learning the language;
- you are building only one project.

There are drawbacks to using a version of Ruby that is installed with Homebrew:
- Homebrew may update Ruby to a new version when you upgrade other Homebrew packages;
- you can't switch between multiple Ruby versions.

Most developers use a software version manager to install Ruby. It will help you manage multiple versions of Ruby. I recommend [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Asdf can manage versions of many languages, including Ruby and Node. See instructions, [Install Asdf](/ruby/5.html). If you will only develop in Ruby, I recommend Frum, the newest and fastest Ruby version manager. See [Install Ruby with Frum](/ruby/14.html).

### Mac system Ruby

MacOS comes with a "system Ruby" pre-installed. MacOS Big Sur and Catalina include Ruby 2.6.3 which is not the newest version. It's a bad idea to use the Mac system Ruby. See the article [Do not use the MacOS system Ruby](/faq/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby/index.html). You can see the system Ruby with `which ruby` and `ruby -v`.

Leave the system Ruby in place and install the newest Ruby version using Homebrew.

## Install Homebrew

Complete the section, [Install Homebrew](/ruby/3.html), before you start.

## Install Ruby

Use Homebrew to install the newest Ruby version.

```bash
$ brew install ruby
```

You’ll see diagnostic messages and progress updates.

### Configure the shell environment

You'll need to set the Homebrew-installed Ruby to take priority over the system Ruby. Also you'll need to set the `$PATH` environment variable to add the directory used for Ruby gems.

Edit the `~/.zshrc` file in your text editor. If you haven’t installed a text editor, use the macOS TextEdit application. Here’s a shortcut to open the file in TextEdit from the Terminal:

```bash
$ open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Set the `$PATH` environment variable. Add this at the end of your `~/.zshrc` file. On Mac Intel:

```bash
if [ -d "/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

On Apple silicon:

```bash
if [ -d "/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

This sets the Homebrew-installed Ruby to a higher priority than the system Ruby and adds the directory used for Ruby gems.

Save the file.

🚩 Close and reopen the Terminal window for the changes to the `~/.zshrc` file to be recognized.

### Confirm Ruby installation

Check the `$PATH` environment variable.

 ```bash
 $ echo $PATH
 /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
 ```

On Apple silicon, you'll see `/opt/homebrew/`. On Mac Intel, you'll see `/usr/local/`.

You can confirm that Homebrew installed Ruby with `brew list`.

```bash
$ brew list
==> Formulae
libyaml		openssl@1.1	readline	ruby
```

You can see a list of the dependencies installed for Ruby with `brew deps --tree --installed`.

```bash
$ brew deps --tree --installed
libyaml

openssl@1.1

readline

ruby
├── libyaml
├── openssl@1.1
└── readline
```

Verify that the newest version of Ruby is installed with `ruby -v`.

When this was written, Ruby 3.0.0 was the newest version (released on Dec 25, 2020).

### Troubleshooting

If you see Ruby version 2.6.3, it is the system Ruby. Try closing and re-opening the terminal window.

If you need to uninstall Ruby, see the guide [Uninstall Ruby](/ruby/9.html).

### Next

Optimize the Ruby development environment by updating gems. See the [Update Gems](/ruby/7.html) section next.
