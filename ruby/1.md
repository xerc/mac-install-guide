## Update macOS

It's best to use the newest macOS version. The latest release is macOS Big Sur 11.0 (Big Sur was released on November 12, 2020). If you have an older Mac, Big Sur will run slowly, so you might want to use macOS Catalina.

### Upgrade macOS

Check your macOS version. Under the Apple menu, check "About This Mac." It should show "Version 10.15.7” (for Catalina) or "Version 11.0.1” (for Big Sur) or newer.

If you need to upgrade, see Apple's instructions [Upgrade to macOS Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/). From macOS Catalina 10.15 or Mojave 10.14, you can upgrade using Software Update in System Preferences. For earlier versions, you can upgrade to macOS Big Sur from the App Store. Allow plenty of time for the download and installation (it may take several hours, especially if you've owned your Mac for several years and haven't updated macOS).

After you’ve upgraded, you’ll use the macOS Terminal application to continue with this guide. See the section, [Finding and Using the Mac Terminal](/ruby/14.html), if you need help finding the Terminal.

Next, let's check if your Terminal application is set up properly.

### Z shell

By default, [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (the Z shell) is the program that runs in the Terminal that interprets Unix commands. Before macOS 10.15 Catalina, the Terminal used the Bash shell as its default. Open the Terminal application and check which shell program is running in your terminal:

```bash
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
```

Don't type the `$` (that's just a prompt to let you know you are in the console).

If you see `/bin/bash` you can update the default to Zsh by running `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.

### Configuring the shell

You can configure the Zsh system environment by creating a file in your user home folder that the Z shell will read when the Terminal application is launched. The configuration file is named `.zshrc`. By the way, if you’re curious, the `rc` in the file name stands for “run commands.”

The `.zshrc` file doesn't exist by default in macOS so you need to create it. First, in the Terminal, make sure you are in your home folder:

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/daniel
```

Check if the file exists already:

```bash
$ ls .zshrc
ls: .zshrc: No such file or directory
```

If the file already exists, you can edit it. Otherwise, create an empty  `.zshrc` file and check that it exists:

```bash
$ touch .zshrc
$ ls .zshrc
.zshrc
```

Now, when needed, you can edit the file. You'll need to edit the `.zshrc` file when you set up the software version manager, so it's good to have it ready.

Setting the  `$PATH` in the `.zshrc` file lets you specify the folder that contains the latest Ruby version.

### Tip: macOS hidden files

The `.zshrc` file is hidden so you won’t see it in the macOS file browser when you want to edit it.

Configuration files are often hidden in macOS. It’s easy to hide a file; just use a dot as the first character in the file name.

You can list all files, including hidden files, with the `ls -lag` command in the Terminal.

In the macOS Finder (the file browser), you can enter Command + Shift + . to show hidden files. If you want to hide those files again, you can enter the same keystrokes.

You can force the Mac to always display hidden files by entering the following command in the Terminal application:

```bash
$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder
```

Hidden files will appear in gray in the Finder window.

Your macOS and Terminal application are set up. Next we'll check if Apple's Xcode Command Line Tools are installed.
