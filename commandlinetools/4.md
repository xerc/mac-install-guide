## Install Xcode Command Line Tools Directly

Many developers set up a local development environment with Homebrew, the popular macOS package manager. The Homebrew  installation process offers an option to install Xcode Command Line Tools (see [Install Xcode Command Line Tools with Homebrew](/commandlinetools/3.html)). As an alternative, if you'd like to install Xcode Command Line Tools directly, without Homebrew, here are instructions.

## Steps

Here are steps to install Xcode Command Line Tools directly.
- Check and update macOS version.
- Check if Xcode Command Line Tools was previously installed.
- Use `xcode-select –install` to install Command Line Tools.

These instructions are for a terminal running Zsh, the Z shell, on a newer Mac. Older Macs may be running the bash shell and you should upgrade.

Before you get started, it's a good idea to [check the macOS version](/commandlinetools/1.html) and [check if Xcode Command Line Tools was previously installed](/commandlinetools/2.html).

## Triggering installation of Xcode Command Line Tools

Apple makes it easy to install Xcode Command Line Tools. If you try to run any recognized command line tool in the Terminal application, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

Here are examples of commands that will trigger a prompt to install Xcode Command Line Tools:

- `xcode-select` - a utility for switching among more than one command line tools directory
- `clang` - a compiler that turns C/C++/Objective-C source code into an executable program
- `gcc` - the GNU compiler
- `git` - the save-as-you-go version control system

Running any of these commands in the terminal will bring up a prompt to install Xcode Command Line Tools. Here we'll use  `xcode-select` to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

## Use 'xcode-select' to install Xcode Command Line Tools

The command `xcode-select --install` will open a dialog for installation of the command line tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

You'll see a panel that asks you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

Xcode Command Line Tools installation takes 1.5 minutes on a 2021 Mac M1 Mini, with a 100Mbps Internet connection. It's significantly slower on Mac Intel over a slow Internet connection.

## Verify installation of Xcode Command Line Tools

Verify that you've successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

Check that you can run `git`:

```bash
git --version
git version 2.30.1 (Apple Git-130)
```

You've seen how to install Command Line Tools directly from the terminal.
