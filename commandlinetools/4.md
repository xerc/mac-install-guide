## Install Xcode Command Line Tools Directly

Xcode Command Line Tools are tools for software developers that run on the command line, in the Terminal application. See [What are Xcode Command Line Tools?](/commandlinetools/index.html)

Many developers set up a local development environment with Homebrew, the popular macOS package manager. The Homebrew  installation process offers an option to install Xcode Command Line Tools (see [Install Xcode Command Line Tools with Homebrew](/commandlinetools/3.html)). As an alternative, if you'd like to install Xcode Command Line Tools directly, without Homebrew, here are instructions.

### Steps

Here are steps to install Xcode Command Line Tools directly.
- Check and update macOS version.
- Check if Xcode Command Line Tools was previously installed.
- Use `xcode-select â€“-install` to install Command Line Tools.

These instructions are for a terminal running Zsh, the Z shell, on a newer Mac. Older Macs may be running the bash shell and you should upgrade.

Before you get started, it's a good idea to [check the macOS version](/commandlinetools/1.html) and [check if Xcode Command Line Tools was previously installed](/commandlinetools/2.html).

## Triggering installation of Xcode Command Line Tools

Apple makes it easy to install Xcode Command Line Tools. If you try to run any recognized command line tool in the Terminal application, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

Here are examples of commands that will trigger a prompt to install Xcode Command Line Tools:

- `clang` - a compiler that turns C/C++/Objective-C source code into an executable program
- `gcc` - the GNU compiler
- `git` - the save-as-you-go version control system

In facts, almost any of the commands in the [List of Xcode Command Line Tools](/commandlinetools/8.html) will trigger the installation prompt.

## Use 'xcode-select' to install Xcode Command Line Tools

The command  `xcode-select` is a utility for switching among more than one command line tools directory. It also can be used to install Xcode Command Line Tools with the command `xcode-select --install`.

The command `xcode-select --install` will open a dialog for installation of the command line tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

You'll see a panel that asks you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

Xcode Command Line Tools installation from the prompt panel takes 8 minutes on a 2021 Mac M1 Mini, with a 100Mbps Internet connection. It's significantly slower on Mac Intel over a slow Internet connection.
