## Reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools

Xcode Command Line Tools are tools for software developers that run on the command line, in the Terminal application. See [What are Xcode Command Line Tools?](/commandlinetools/index.html)

You may wish to reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools for a variety of reasons:
- you've checked the Xcode Command Line Tools version and it is not current;
- you are using Homebrew and encountered errors with `brew doctor`;
- a macOS upgrade may have partially removed Command Line Tools;
- you need a clean reinstall to diagnose other problems.

If you haven't already removed Xcode Command Line Tools, see the section [Uninstall Xcode Command Line Tools](/commandlinetools/7.html).

### Xcode Command Line Tools is out of date

See the section, [Check if Xcode Command Line Tools is already installed](/commandlinetools/2.html), to check the version number of Xcode Command Line Tools. If the version is out of date, first [Uninstall Xcode Command Line Tools](/commandlinetools/7.html) and then reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools directly (see below).

### After Homebrew errors

If you've installed Homebrew, the popular package manager for macOS, and you get errors when you run `brew doctor`, you may need to reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
% brew doctor

Warning: Git could not be found in your PATH.
Homebrew uses Git for several internal functions, and some formulae use Git
checkouts instead of stable tarballs. You may want to install Git:
  brew install git

Warning: No developer tools installed.
Install the Command Line Tools:
  xcode-select --install
```

There is no need to reinstall Homebrew. Just install Xcode Command Line Tools directly (see below).

### After a macOS upgrade

After a macOS upgrade (for example, from macOS 11.2.2 to 11.2.3), the macOS upgrade process may remove the Command Line Tools. This can be annoying if you install an upgrade and then find you can't use commands such as `git`. You may encounter an error like:

```bash
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools),
missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
```

Checking for the Command Line Tools folder may show that the folder is there:

```bash
$ xcode-select -p
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

But look closely and the Command Line Tools folder may be missing essential folders and files after a macOS upgrade. It should look like this:

```bash
$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  160 Jan  9 07:43 Library
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  160 Apr 24 16:19 SDKs
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  224 Apr 24 16:19 usr
```

It may look like this after an upgrade:

```bash
$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  7 root  wheel  224 Apr 24 16:19 usr
```

## Reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools

```

A message will pop up on the screen. Confirm that you want to install the tools.

Xcode Command Line Tools installation takes 1.5 minutes on a 2021 Mac M1 Mini, with a 100Mbps Internet connection. It's significantly slower on Mac Intel over a slow Internet connection.

You'll see a confirmation message when installation is complete.

## Verify installation of Xcode Command Line Tools

Verify that you've successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select -p

```

Check that you can run `git`:

```bash
git --version
git version 2.30.1 (Apple Git-130)
```
