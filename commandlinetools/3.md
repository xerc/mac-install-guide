## Install Xcode Command Line Tools with Homebrew

Xcode Command Line Tools are tools for software developers that run on the command line, in the Terminal application. See [What are Xcode Command Line Tools?](/commandlinetools/index.html)

The easiest way to install Xcode Command Line Tools is by installing Homebrew, the popular package manager for macOS. When you install Homebrew, you'll be offered the option of installing Xcode Command Line Tools. This is a recent addition to the Homebrew installation process, so older guides or blog posts won't mention it.

With Homebrew, you can install almost any open source developer tool. Since you'll probably need Homebrew in your local development environment, you might as well let Homebrew install Xcode Command Line Tools for you.

Tip: If you did not use a password to log in to your Mac (that is, if your password is blank), you cannot install Homebrew.

## Steps

Here are steps to install Xcode Command Line Tools using Homebrew.
- Check and update macOS version.
- Check if Xcode Command Line Tools was previously installed.
- Install Homebrew (with an option to install Xcode Command Line Tools).
- Update the shell configuration (Mac M1 only).

These instructions are for a terminal running Zsh, the Z shell, on a newer Mac. Older Macs may be running the bash shell and you should upgrade.

### Check for Homebrew


If you've already [checked the macOS version](/commandlinetools/1.html) and [checked if Xcode Command Line Tools was previously installed](/commandlinetools/2.html), then check if Homebrew is installed:

```bash
$ brew
```

If Homebrew is not installed, you will see:

```bash
zsh: command not found: brew
```

If Homebrew is not installed, there should be no Homebrew files in  `/usr/local` (for macOS Intel) or `/opt/homebrew` (for Apple Silicon).

### Brew install

Homebrew provides an installation script you can download and run with a single command (check that it hasn't changed at the [Homebrew site](https://brew.sh/)). This is the easiest way to install Homebrew.

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

The Homebrew installation script will ask you to enter your Mac user password. This is the password you used to sign into your Mac.

```bash
Password:
```

You won't see the characters as you type. Press enter when you are done.

You'll see a list of files and folders that Homebrew will install.

### Option to install XCode Command Line Tools

If you haven't already installed XCode Command Line Tools, you'll see a message that "The XCode Command Line Tools will be installed." Press return to continue when prompted by the Homebrew installation script. It takes five to ten minutes to download and install the Command Line Tools.

You’ll see diagnostic and progress messages. Homebrew installation takes 1.5 minutes on a 2021 Mac M1 Mini, with a 100Mbps Internet connection. It's significantly slower on Mac Intel over a slow Internet connection.

On Mac Intel machines, that's all you need to do; Homebrew is ready to use. On Mac Intel, Homebrew installs itself into the `/usr/local/bin` directory, which is already configured for access by the shell with the macOS default `$PATH` environment variable (the default is set by the `/usr/libexec/path_helper` command).

### Add Homebrew shell configuration

On Apple Silicon machines, there's one more step. Homebrew files are installed into the `/opt/homebrew` folder. But the folder is not part of the default `$PATH`. Follow Homebrew's advice and create a `~/.zprofile` file which contains a command which sets up Homebrew. Homebrew shows instructions at the end of the installation process:

```bash
- Add Homebrew to your PATH in ~/.zprofile:
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

The Homebrew console output will show your user directory name (the example above contains the Unix `~` tilde shortcut instead).

#### Alternative shell configuration

Alternatively, you can use a favorite text editor to edit the `~/.zprofile` file. Or `open ~/.zprofile` to use TextEdit to edit the file. You'll need to add the line `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` to the file.

Some developers don't use the `~/.zprofile` file, preferring to set the shell configuration in the `~/.zshrc` file. That's okay, but the  `~/.zshrc` file is evaluated every time a shell is launched. The `~/.zprofile` file is only evaluated when you login to your mac user account, so setting the shell with the `~/.zprofile` file happens only once at login, saving some overhead.

### Verify Homebrew installation

After you've installed Homebrew, check that Homebrew is installed properly.

```bash
$ brew doctor
```

You should see:

```bash
Your system is ready to brew.
```

On Apple Silicon, if you see `zsh: command not found: brew`, check that you've created a `~/.zprofile` file as described above and restart your terminal application.

If Homebrew is successfully installed, there will be Homebrew files in  `/usr/local` (for macOS Intel) or `/opt/homebrew` (for Apple Silicon).

Now you have both Xcode Command Line Tools and Homebrew installed. If you want to learn more about adding Homebrew packages to set up your development environment, see [Install a Homebrew Package](/homebrew/6.html).
